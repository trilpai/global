## 2 Country Brief

Belarus, a landlocked Eastern European country, has traditionally maintained strong IT capabilities, especially in outsourcing and game development. Known for companies like EPAM Systems and Wargaming.net, it once had a thriving tech park in Minsk. However, due to increasing political repression, global sanctions, and talent exodus, many tech companies have relocated. While the local job market has shrunk, remote work and cross-border collaboration remain feasible for Indian freelancers or expats already studying or based in the region.
