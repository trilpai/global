## 2 Country Brief

Haiti, the first Black republic born from a revolution, is a land of grit, pride, and persistent hope. While struggling with political instability and frequent natural disasters, the country also has a vibrant informal economy, a creative youth population, and efforts at digital renewal. Internet access is improving in urban areas, and a few IT training initiatives are being piloted. For Indian developers, Haiti is not a conventional destination, but remote work from Haiti (especially for NGOs or global orgs) is feasible with the right safeguards.
