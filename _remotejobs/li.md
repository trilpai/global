## 2 Country Brief

Liechtenstein, a picturesque microstate nestled between Switzerland and Austria, is known for its stunning alpine landscapes, strong financial sector, and high standard of living.

For Indian developers, it's more likely a destination for high-skilled migration, elite academic exchanges, or remote EU-based contracts via Switzerland or Austria.
