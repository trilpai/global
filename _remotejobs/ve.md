## 2 Country Brief

Venezuela, once a booming oil economy, is now seeing a rise in remote tech freelancers and digital nomads amid domestic instability. With hyperinflation and economic hardship, many Venezuelans have turned to coding, remote work, and crypto as economic lifelines. While the local job market is strained, the country has one of Latin America's largest pools of self-trained remote developers. For Indian devs, Venezuela presents limited in-country jobs but ample collaboration potential with its remote-savvy diaspora and low living costs.
