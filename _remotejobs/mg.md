## 2 Country Brief

Madagascar, the fourth-largest island in the world, is globally known for its unique biodiversity and ecological wonders. Though historically rural, the country is making slow but steady progress in digital services, especially in e-government, agriculture tech, and outsourcing support. French remains dominant, but English is gaining ground in tech spaces. With low living costs, a peaceful society, and NGO-backed digital programs, Madagascar is a calm base for remote Indian developers or freelance tech consultants.
