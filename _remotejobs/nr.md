## 2 Country Brief

Nauru is the world’s smallest island nation — a single raised coral island in the central Pacific. Known for its phosphate mining legacy, the country now relies heavily on external aid, particularly from Australia. English is widely spoken, and although tech infrastructure is minimal, Nauru is peaceful, digitally aware, and open to remote work initiatives. For Indian developers, Nauru offers a low-distraction, niche base for freelancing, education tech, or NGO-aligned digital roles.
