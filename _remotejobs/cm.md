## 2 Country Brief

Nicknamed "Africa in miniature" for its cultural, climatic, and geographic diversity, Cameroon blends rainforest, desert, mountains, and savannah. The country is slowly digitizing, with Douala emerging as a financial and tech center. While French is dominant, the Anglophone southwest and northwest regions are more accessible for English-speaking professionals. For Indian software developers open to remote work or NGO-aligned tech roles in education, health, or agriculture, Cameroon offers a stable yet vibrant entry point into Central Africa.
