While the tech industry is in early stages, NGOs, UN agencies, and government modernization efforts are driving digital literacy and ICT capacity-building. For Indian developers working remotely or seeking impact-driven projects in a quiet tropical setting, Timor-Leste offers a refreshing off-grid opportunity.
