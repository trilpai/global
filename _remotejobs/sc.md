## 2 Country Brief

Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, is famed for its turquoise waters and eco-conscious tourism. But beyond the postcard beauty, it's investing in a **‚Äúblue economy‚Äù**, digital finance, and government IT modernization. Its small, stable population and English fluency make it surprisingly navigable for Indian tech professionals exploring remote, hybrid, or onsite roles in fintech, maritime logistics, or eco-tech startups. It offers peace, sunlight, and tax-light policies with a global outlook.
