## 2 Country Brief

Micronesia, a remote cluster of islands in the Pacific, is known for its warm hospitality, rich marine life, and U.S.-aligned governance. While its digital economy is still emerging, English is the official language, and USD is the currency — making it a convenient outpost for remote work. Most IT opportunities are tied to government modernization, education, and NGOs. For Indian developers, Micronesia offers a peaceful setting with modest freelance potential and deep cultural immersion.
