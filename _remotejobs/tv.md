## 2 Country Brief

Tuvalu, one of the world’s smallest and most vulnerable island nations, is globally known for its ".tv" internet domain — a digital legacy that contributes significantly to its national income. With English as a co-official language and a peaceful, internet-aware population, Tuvalu is quietly embracing the remote work model. While local tech infrastructure is basic, digital literacy is rising. For Indian developers, Tuvalu offers an unconventional but serene base for async freelancing with Pacific or global clients.
