## 2 Country Brief

The Republic of the Congo, not to be confused with its larger neighbor the DRC, is a peaceful and forest-rich nation in Central Africa. Brazzaville, its compact and well-kept capital, is home to growing fintech, telecom, and e-gov efforts. While French remains dominant, English is gaining slow traction in the tech sector. For Indian software professionals, Congo offers a calm, affordable base with steady internet, clean air, and niche demand for digital skills via startups, NGOs, and remote work.
