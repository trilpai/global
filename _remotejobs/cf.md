## 2 Country Brief

The Central African Republic (CAR) lies at the very heart of the continent—rich in forests, wildlife, and minerals, yet among the least digitally developed nations. Political instability has slowed progress, but NGOs, UN agencies, and the government are laying groundwork for digital education, e-health, and civic services. For Indian tech professionals, CAR offers remote consulting or NGO-led opportunities, especially in systems design, mobile apps, and educational tech for development.
