## ✨ Why This Exists

India has some of the best young software engineers in the world — but remote opportunities are often scattered, unclear, or hard to evaluate across countries. This guide brings clarity by answering:

- Which countries offer realistic remote job opportunities?
- What are the average salaries for 3–5 years experience?
- How English-friendly and visa-friendly is the region?
- How compatible is the local time zone with IST?
- What’s the cost of living and cultural fit like?
